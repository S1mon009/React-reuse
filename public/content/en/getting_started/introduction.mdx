## Entry

Welcome to our comprehensive library of custom React hooks, utility functions, components and animations, **designed to streamline and enhance your development workflow**. This collection of tools is built with a strong focus on reusability, performance, and developer experience. Whether you're working on complex state management, handling side effects, or simplifying common **UI patterns**, our hooks and utilities will empower you to build robust and scalable applications with ease.

Our entire library is written in TypeScript, providing you with type safety and autocompletion right out of the box. Each hook and utility has been rigorously tested using Vitest, ensuring reliability and bug-free behavior across a wide range of use cases. We also follow best practices in linting and code style to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.

In this document, weâ€™ll dive into three core aspects that make our library stand out: the comprehensive testing approach, the advantages of TypeScript, and the consistent use of code linting.

### Testing with Vitest

One of the main pillars of our library is the rigorous testing process we apply to every hook and utility. By utilizing **Vitest** a fast, modern testing framework for TypeScript and JavaScript we ensure that every piece of code works as expected in various scenarios. From edge cases to everyday usage patterns, each hook undergoes thorough testing to guarantee that it behaves correctly, even under edge cases or uncommon user interactions.

Vitest offers a fast feedback loop and integrates seamlessly with TypeScript, making it ideal for our testing needs. We use both **unit tests and integration tests** to cover different aspects of functionality. The high level of test coverage ensures that our library remains reliable, even as new features are added or as it evolves over time. Our commitment to test-driven development means that you can confidently integrate our hooks into your project, knowing they will perform as expected.

### Written in TypeScript

Our entire library is written in **TypeScript**, a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to your code. TypeScript provides numerous benefits, such as better tooling, enhanced code readability, and early detection of bugs during development. By using TypeScript in all of our hooks and utilities, we ensure that you get the most out of your development experience, including improved code autocompletion, type safety, and more predictable behavior.

The type definitions within our hooks and utilities provide robust contract enforcement, preventing common errors before they occur. TypeScript also allows us to create more expressive **APIs**, making it easier for developers to understand how to use each hook properly. With type inference, developers can often get suggestions directly from their IDE, improving development speed while reducing the chance of runtime errors. This ensures that our tools are both developer-friendly and highly reliable in production environments.

### Linting and Code Quality

Maintaining a **clean and consistent codebase** is a core principle in our development process. To achieve this, we use strict linting rules and follow best practices for code formatting. Our library is fully linted using ESLint, ensuring that the code is not only functional but also clean, readable, and maintainable. This helps reduce technical debt and makes the library easier to contribute to or modify over time.

Linting also enforces consistency across all hooks and utilities, ensuring that they adhere to a uniform coding style. This makes it easier for developers to understand the code, catch potential errors early, and prevent bad practices from creeping in. Additionally, we run linters as part of our continuous integration pipeline, meaning that every piece of code is checked for quality before it gets merged into the main codebase.

This library offers a carefully crafted set of tools for modern React development. With a strong foundation in testing, TypeScript integration, and a focus on code quality, our hooks and utilities are reliable, developer-friendly, and designed to scale with your project needs. Whether you're looking to streamline your codebase or enhance your application's performance, this collection provides the solutions to do so with confidence.
