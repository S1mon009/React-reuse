## Linting and Code Quality

Maintaining a clean, consistent, and high-quality codebase is a fundamental principle in our development process. A well-maintained codebase fosters collaboration, scalability, and ease of management as the project evolves. Below, we outline how we achieve and enforce these standards.

### Why Code Quality Matters

- **Readability:** Clean code is easier to understand and modify.
- **Maintainability:** A well-structured codebase reduces technical debt and supports long-term development.
- **Collaboration:** Consistent code makes it easier for teams and contributors to work together effectively.

### How We Enforce Code Quality

1. **Using ESLint for Linting**\
   We rely on **ESLint**, a powerful tool for enforcing coding standards. It ensures that:

- Code adheres to predefined rules and best practices.
- Issues are detected early in the development cycle.
- The library remains clean, readable, and maintainable.

2. **Adopting a Uniform Coding Style**\
   Consistency is key. To ensure a unified look and feel across the codebase:

- All hooks and utilities follow the same coding conventions.
- Developers can easily navigate and understand the structure and logic.

3. **Automating Quality Checks with CI**\
   Our **Continuous Integration (CI)** pipeline includes automatic linting checks:

- Every code change is analyzed for quality before merging.
- Potential issues are flagged early, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

## Benefits of Linting

- **Error Prevention:** Identifies issues such as syntax errors or bad practices.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Standardized code is easier for teams and contributors to work with.
- **Future-Proofing:** Clean, consistent code is more adaptable to future updates and enhancements.

By prioritizing linting and code quality, we ensure that our library remains robust, reliable, and easy to use. This commitment builds a strong foundation for future development and creates an environment where developers can thrive.
